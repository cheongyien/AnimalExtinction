			<span class="subheading">Introduction</span>
			<br><br>
			Malayan tiger is one of the smallest tigers, which can weigh up to 120 kg and can be as long as 2.5 m. Most commonly, malayan tigers are found in peninsular Malaysia and in certain region of Thailand. These tigers have reddish brown fur and black stripes as well as white fur around the eyes. These characteristics are beneficial for malayan tigers to camouflage during hunting as the colours make them difficult to be seen. Wild boar, baby elephants, sun bears and deers are often hunted by malayan tigers.
			<br><br>
			Cubs are most often given birth in caves. However, due to these tigers being critically endangered, breeding facilities are developed in Malaysia to increase the successful rate of breeding. Malayan tigers are born with their eyes closed and will only gain full vision after two weeks. These tigers have a lifespan of around 15 to 20 years.
			<br><br>
			According to WWF, there are only 250 to 340 malayan tigers left currently. 
			<br><br><br><br>
			<span class="subheading">Why are they facing extinction</span>
			<br><br>
			The two main factors that contribute to the decrement of malayan tigers’ population are the loss of natural habitats and illegal hunting. Due to the increase in human population, the demand for food and infrastructure rises. In order to cope with the demand, more of the tigers’ habitats are destroyed for agricultural purposes as well as for infrastructure development. Hence, the great reduction of the area of natural habitats has forced malayan tigers to live in smaller areas, competing for food and other resources.
			<br><br>
			Furthermore, malayan tigers are often hunted illegally to be sold for different purposes at a high price. For instance, the tigers’ bones can be sold to be used in traditional medicine. In addition, the skin is also purchased by customers for luxurious decorations.
