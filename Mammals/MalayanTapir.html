			<br><br>
			Malayan tapir, also known as Asian tapir, can weigh up to 320 kg and can be as long as 2.5 m. These tapirs are found in several countries, including Malaysia, Thailand, Myanmar and Indonesia. In addition to being known as Asian tapir, Malayan tapirs are sometimes referred as Oreo tapir as these tapirs have a colour pattern of black and white. Unlike adult tapirs, baby tapir have white stripes and spots on a black coloured body. Both of the characteristics of the adult and baby tapirs are helpful in camouflaging in the shadows of the forest, protecting them from predators. Another interesting characteristic of the tapir is the elongated nose, which is mostly used for picking food. Malayan tapirs usually feed on barks, leaves, fruits and grass.
			<br><br>
			Malayan tapirs are monogamous. In other words, each tapir will have only one mate during the reproductive season from May to June. Female tapirs usually give birth to a calf every two years after a gestation duration of around thirteen to thirteen and a half months. Malayan tapirs have a lifespan of up to 30 years.
			<br><br>
			According to IUCN, there are approximately 1500 tapirs in Malaysia, 450 in Sumatra and 250 in both Thailand and Myanmar. 
			<br><br><br><br>
			<span class="subheading">Why are they facing extinction</span>
			<br><br>
			The main reason for the endangerment of Malayan tapirs left is the loss of natural habitats. The demand for palm oil has been increasing nowadays as it has a large variety of uses, including biodiesel, detergents, lip sticks, margarine and many other products. Furthermore, palm oil industries are able to produce a larger yield at a lower cost when compared to vegetable oil. In order to cope with this increasing demand, the rate of uncontrolled deforestation for palm oil industriesâ€™ plantation has also increased. This in turn damages the natural habitats of malayan tapirs, endangering the species.
			<br><br>
			Apart from habitat loss, hunting of malayan tapirs has also become a growing concern for this species. Malayan tapirs are often hunted to be sold at a high price or for personal collection.
			Furthermore, malayan tapirs are often the victims of road accidents. This also contributes to the decreasing population of the animal.
