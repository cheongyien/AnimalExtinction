            <span class="subheading">Introduction</span><br><br>
            There are several types of bluefin tuna namely Atlantic, Pacific and Southern. Among the three types, Atlantic Bluefin Tuna is the most endangered species.
            They are well-known with the ambitiously migratory characteristics as they migrate across all oceans and have the capability to dive deeper than a distance of 3,000 feet.
            Atlantic Bluefin Tuna's torpedo-shaped and streamlined body are responsible for its fast speed and high endurance. They can swim up to 43 miles per hour using their powerful tail as well as dorsal and pectoral fins that are able to retract into slots to reduce drag.
            They are warm-blooded but at the same time are comfortable in cold water. They are able to camouflages in water well due to its metallic blue colour on top and silver-white on the bottom.
            They are the top predator in marine food chain and plays a vital role in maintaining the balance of the ocean environment. They have the sharpest vision of any bony fish and thus hunt by sight on smaller fish, crustaceans, squid, eels, herring, mackerel or even filter feed on zoonplakton.
            Their varied diet and voraccious appetite have also contributed to their big size.<br><br>        
            <span class="subheading">Why are they facing extinction</span><br><br>
            Atlantic Bluefin Tuna are so highly sought after due to the fact that they are delicious to be served as delicacy for sushi and sashimi, mainly in Asia high end market.
            The increase in demand has caused its price to spike up in the 1970's, especially in Japan. Large and breeding-age bluefins are usually the target for fishermen. 
            Hence, overfishing and illegal fishing have cause Atlantic Bluefin Tuna to be critically endangered.
