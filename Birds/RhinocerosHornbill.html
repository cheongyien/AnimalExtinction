        <br><br>
        Rhinoceros Hornbill is used as the state bird of Sarawak, Malaysia and considered as the Country`s National Bird. People of Sarawak believes that this bird is the chief of the worldly bird and it`s status is used to welcome the god of the augural birds.
        <br><br>
        The rhinoceros hornbill is a large arboreal hornbill, 80cm to 90cm long whereas it`s weight varies from 2465g to 2960g for the male while 2040g to 2330g for the female.
        The plumage is predominately black, with white legs and vent and a white tail with a black band. The huge bill and casque are orange and red, the colour coming from preen oil rubbed on from the preen gland above the tail. The eyes of the male are red with black rims, and white with red rims in the female.
        <br><br>
         The courtship and bonding of these birds are critical, as the female must trust the male to provide her with everything when she is incubating and raising chicks. These hornbills make their nests inside tree trunks, and the female stays inside with the eggs and then with the chicks, while the male brings them food. 
         <br><br>
        Once the chicks are fully feathered and old enough to leave the nest, the parents chip away the dry mud to let the chicks out.
        <br><br><br><br>
        <span class="subheading">Why is it facing extinction?</span><br><br>
        Habitat destruction has led to the loss of the large trees the species requires for breeding, which in turn makes it easier for poachers to find the rhinoceros hornbill. Due to this, the species was uplisted to vulnerable from near threatened on the IUCN Red List in 2018 as the last recorded count of this species is 28.<br>
        They are being hunted for it`s meat, skull and feathers. It is frequently shot at by poachers due to confusion with the highly sought-after helmeted hornbill.<br>
