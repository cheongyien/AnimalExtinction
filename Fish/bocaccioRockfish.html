        Bocaccio Rockfish is known to be slow-growing, late mature and long lived rockfish where they can have a lifespan of up to 50 years.
        There are even records saying that the female of the species has a maximum age of 52 years with a 20 years generation time. Even though they are found in Alaska off Krozoff, West Coast, Mexico, Canada, United States and even the Kodiak Islands,
        they are most commonly found between Oregon and Nothern Baja California. Juveniles are pelagic and settle in near shore nursery areas then move to deeper habitats. Adults are usually found over rocky bottom to about 320m.
        They have been found at water depth ranging from 12m to 478m but are most abundant at 50m to 250m. Adult colour varies from shades of pink to pink-brown, grey or red that extends down over their belly. After capture, their colours are even brighter and are usually reddist brown.
        Young fish are generally light bronze with speckling over the sides and back. As they age, their color generally becomes darker and the speckling fades. The young Bocaccio form schools and they feed on fishes including other rockfishes.
        The Bocaccio Rockfish's spines can be mildly poisonous just like many other roskfish and may cause unpleasant pain if one get poked.<br><br>
            <span class="subheading">Why are they facing extinction</span><br><br>
        Factors that causes Bocaccio Rockfish to become endangered are overfishing, habitat degradation, bycatch and its slow growing rate.
        Rockfish are vulnerable to overfishing as they only reproduce when they are 5 to 20 years old and very few of their youngs actually survive to adulthood.
        The rockfish's larvae are food source for marine fish, especially juvenile salmon and also seabirds. Rockfish caught by bycatch do not get to survive in water due to injuries from barotrauma.
