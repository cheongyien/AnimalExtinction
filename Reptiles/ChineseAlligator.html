			<br><br>
			The Critically Endangered Chinese alligator is the only species in its entire family found outside of the Americas. Its closest living relative is the famous American alligator.
			The Chinese alligator is one of the smaller species of crocodilian, growing to only around 2 metres in length. This is in sharp contrast to their sister species, the American alligator, which can reach more than twice their size. These secretive alligators spend a large part of the year in complex networks of underground burrows containing above and below-ground pools of water. Extensive use of these burrows has allowed the species to persist in wetlands surrounded by densely populated areas.
			Genetic evidence suggests this diminutive crocodilian split from its American sister around 40 million years ago and, together, the alligators split from all other living creatures around the same time as the extinction of their close relatives, the dinosaurs!
			Sadly, this unique alligator is on the brink of extinction, with around only 100 individuals remaining in the wild. The species has experienced extreme population declines and a drastic reduction in range and is therefore listed as Critically Endangered by the IUCN Red List. 
			<br><br><br><br>
			<span class="subheading">Why are they facing extinction</span>
			<br><br>
			The main factors driving this decline have been habitat loss, fragmentation, pollution and hunting. Though hunting pressure is now much reduced, the loss of habitat has been virtually complete.
			However, conservation efforts are underway for the Chinese alligator. Monitoring programmes have been established alongside large-scale captive breeding endeavours. Following the identification and restoration of suitable habitat, multiple successful reintroductions of captive-bred individuals have occurred, indicating the species may be able to adapt to restored habitat following captive breeding efforts.
