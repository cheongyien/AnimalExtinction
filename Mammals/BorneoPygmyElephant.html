			<br><br>
			Borneo Pygmy Elephant is the smallest size Asian elephant, which has an average height of 2.2 m and an average weight of 2500 kg. It has large ears as well as a tail, which can be extremely long that it touches the ground. Compared to other Asian elephants, borneo pygmy elephants seem to have a less aggressive behaviour. Although these elephants are small in size, adult borneo pygmy elephants can consume up to 150 kg of food every day. Fruits and grasses are mostly eaten by these elephants.
			<br><br>
			Borneo pygmy elephants have a lifespan of around 55 and 70 years. With a gestation period of around 19 to 22 months, which is almost 2 years, female elephants are able to give birth to about seven calves.
			<br><br>
			According to WWF, there are approximately 1500 borneo pygmy elephants left. 
			<br><br><br><br>
			<span class="subheading">Why are they facing extinction</span>
			<br><br>
			The main factor that causes borneo pygmy elephants to be endangered is the loss of habitats. Since borneo pygmy elephants can consume up to 150 kg of food per day, they require a large area to search for a sufficient amount of food. However, due to the rising demand of humans, more forests are being fragmented to be converted to palm oil plantations, agricultural lands and other infrastructures. 
			<br><br>
			In addition to reducing the area for food searching, deforestation also results in an increased chance of the elephants being in contact with humans. For years, many of these elephants were injured due to the illegal snares set by people around the area.
