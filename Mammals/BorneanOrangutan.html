			<br><br>
			Bornean Orangutans, which are also known as man of the forest, are found in Malaysia and Indonesia. These species usually feed on fruits, flowers, barks, honey and insects. Male and female Bornean orangutans can be differed by their size. Males can grow up to 1.5 m in height and 90 kg in weight, whereas females can only grow up to 1.1 m in height and 50 kg in weight. Unlike females, male Bornean orangutans can be classified into two categories, namely flanged and unflanged. Flanged Bornean orangutans are usually bigger in size and have large cheek pads on both sides of the face.
			<br><br>
			Bornean orangutans have low reproductive rate due to several reasons. Firstly, it takes a long time, which is around 6 to 15 years, for these species to be sexually mature. In addition, orangutans usually reproduce only a single offspring each time after a gestation period of 9 months.
			<br><br>
			According to WWF, approximately 104,700 Bornean orangutans are left. 
			<br><br><br><br>
			<span class="subheading">Why are they facing extinction</span>
			<br><br>
			Illegal trades as well as conflicts with humans are two factors that contribute greatly in endangering Bornean orangutans. In order to cope with humans’ increasing demand for different resources, more forests are destroyed to be used for palm oil plantations, for agricultural activities as well as for the development of different infrastructures, including roads and buildings. This causes the loss of natural habitats of the Bornean orangutans. 
			<br><br>
			In addition, young bornean orangutans are usually caught by humans to be kept as pets or to be sold in the market. In certain cases, when a particular young orangutan is targeted, the mother will also be killed. Hence, this contributes to the decreasing population of bornean orangutans.
			<br><br>
			Bornean orangutans require a sufficient amount of a variety of fruits to survive. However, it is difficult to find enough food in the forests sometimes. Therefore, Bornean orangutans might move to humans’ agricultural areas or palm oil plantations to search for more food sources. In certain cases, these orangutans are shot to death when encountering humans.
