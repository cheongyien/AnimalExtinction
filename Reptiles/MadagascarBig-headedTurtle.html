			<br><br>
			The Critically Endangered Madagascar big-headed turtle is the world’s most Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered reptile. In fact, this species has the highest EDGE score of any terrestrial vertebrate!
			The Madagascan big-headed turtle is a unique and prehistoric reptile. The species is endemic to lowland waterways and wetlands of western Madagascar, where adults feeds upon molluscs and plants and scavenges dead animals. As its name suggests, this turtle has a particularly large head relative to its body. Due to its colouration, it can sometimes appear to have large plates of gold armouring its over-sized head and body.
			This turtle, the sole surviving species in its genus, sits alone at the end of a branch of the tree of life which stretches back more than 80 million years to the age of the dinosaurs. To put that in perspective, our branch of the tree of life is a mere twig, stretching back only 7-10 million years before we meet our common ancestor with chimpanzees and bonobos.

			<span class="subheading">Why are they facing extinction</span>
			<br><br>
			Unfortunately, this species is listed as Critically Endangered by the IUCN Red List due to drastic population declines in the past century. This species is also listed as one of the world’s 25 most endangered turtles by the Turtle Conservation Fund. The Madagascar big-headed turtle is under threat from human exploitation for food, habitat degradation and fragmentation. Unfortunately, most populations occur outside protected areas, and even those inside are subjected to exploitation.
			However, the species is listed in CITES Appendix II and conservation efforts are underway. These include captive breeding, community education and population monitoring programmes.
