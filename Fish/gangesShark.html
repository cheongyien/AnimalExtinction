        Sharks are known to be important predators in oceans, but there are also sharks that live in freshwater habitats and Ganges Shark is one of them that live inland.
        Ganges shark is only found in rivers and possibly estuaries, with no confirmed records from oceans and seas. It is among the top 20 for the most threatened shark species and is listed as Critically Endangered species in the IUCN Redlist.
        <br><br>
            <span class="subheading">Why are they facing extinction</span><br><br>
        The main threats to Ganges Shark are habitat degradation and overfishing. Ganges Shark is vulnerable to habitat changes as they live in a narrow band of habitat that is highly affected by human activities.
        Clearing of mangroove trees, constuction of dams and barrages and pollution has caused their habitat to degrade, thus affecting their survival. Ganges shark are usually caught by gillnet for its fins and jaws in international trade. 
        They are fished by locals for their meat and oil as their oil are sought after as a fish attractant.
