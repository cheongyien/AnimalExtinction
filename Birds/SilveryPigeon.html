            <span class="subheading">Introduction</span><br><br>
            The silvery pigeon is not distinguishable from the pied imperial pigeon at a distance, although this is not necessarily true vice versa
        <br><br>
        Most distinguishing characteristics are located on the head, which is shaped differently, with a sloping forehead (rounded in the PIP), conspicuous dark red or purplish eye-wattles (none in the PIP) and eyes, and a bill that is darker at the base (lighter at the base in the PIP), being dusky purple with a pale apple-green tip
        <br><br>
        It is believed to wander around following fruit in season, and was often found in association with much larger flocks of the pied imperial pigeon. It also breeds in these birds' nesting colonies, probably over a period of several months from March or April on. Like most other pigeons, it builds a flimsy stick nest in trees and lays a single white egg, which has a chalky, not glossy shell
        <br><br>
         This species has been classified as Critically Endangered (D1) by BirdLife International, translating into an estimated population of less than fifty mature individuals.
         <br><br>
        Comparison with related species gives an estimate of 350g on average.
        <br><br><br><br>
        <span class="subheading">Why is it facing extinction?</span>
        <br><br>
        Deforestation still plays a role on contributing to the declination of species as many mangrove forests that are the natural habitat for this species are removed.<br>
        The reclamation of the tidal flats and estuarine habitats for infrastructural building has been causing the Chinese Egrets to lose it`s natural habitat.<br>
        Predators such as a feral cat wil jeopardize the breeding of the Silver Pigeons on the offshore islets.<br>
