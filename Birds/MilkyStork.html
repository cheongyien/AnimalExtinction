        <br><br>
        For a medium stork, it can grow up to 91cm to 97cm tall while it`s wing length streches up to 435mm to 500mm long.
        <br><br>
        The extensive white portion of the plumage is completely suffused with a pale creamy yellow during the breeding season, hence the term “milky”. This creamy tint is absent from the plumage during breeding
        <br><br>
        Breeding birds also show a narrow pinkish band of bare skin along the underside of the wing
         <br><br>
        In the National Zoo of Malaysia, hybridisation attempt has been taken with a pair of Milky Stork and Painted interbred to produce a hybrid offspring with a vary appearance.
        <br><br>
        The milky stork's breeding habitat requirements are extensive and undisturbed mangrove forest with tall, outstanding trees and shallow pools within the forest. The tall trees are also used for resting, and there should be sufficient individual limbs from which to take off. With a lack of such suitable trees, manmade alternatives such as cart wheels mounted on poles have been proposed.
        <br><br>
        Common comfort movements in the milky stork include allopreening between breeding partners and head shaking. Individuals perched near incubating partners also carrying out head rubbing, whereby the stork oils the bare head skin on its preen gland and then rubs its head on its plumage
        <br><br><br><br>
        <span class="subheading">Why is it facing extinction?</span>
        <br><br>
        The global milky stork population has been declining substantially, especially from the late 1980s, and has been largely attributable to habitat destruction and disturbance through mangrove deforestation for human activities such as fish farming, tidal rice cultivation,timber exploitation, and in Indonesia, human resettlement.Deforestation has led to a lack of suitable mature trees for the species to nest in and thereby affected breeding success.<br>
        An elevated concentrations of the metal ions have been found in their natural habitat such as copper, zinc and lead. This has been seen where the agrochemicals, corrosion and runoff from jetties and boats flowing into their habitat, contaminating their source of water.<br>
        Breeding colonies have also declined through increased illegal international trade in this bird from the mid-1980s and, especially in South Sumatra, poaching of eggs and juveniles for human consumption.<br>
