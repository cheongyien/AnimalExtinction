        <br><br>
        A mature Lesser Adjutants grows up to 110cm to 120cm in height and 4kg to 5.71kg in weight. It has always been confused with the Greater Adjutant due to it`s general appearance but Lesser Adjutant is typically smaller in size when compared to Greater Adjutant.
        <br><br>
        Lesser Adjutant is identified by it`s nearly naked head and neck but with a few scattered hair-like feathers on it.When breeding season approaches, Lesser Adjutant`s face will turn reddish while it`s neck will turn orange. 
        <br><br>
        During the Lesser Adjutant`s flight, they will retract their necks and the folded neck will appear to be similar with the pouch of the Greater Adjutant. Both the male and female will have similarity in their plumage but the male will tend to have a larger and heavier billed. 
        <br><br>
        They enjoy sitting on telegraphic poles as they are able to do an apparent scanning a marsh for prey. Lesser Adjutant are usually quiet but when they are faced with one of the threat known as Arching Display by the intruders, they will start to extend their neck and gives out a hoarse wail.
        <br><br>
        A hybridization attempt has been made with a pair of Lesser Adjutant and a Painted Stork at Kuala Lumpur Zoo. The successful hybridization has yield a young offspring with a plumage and bill-size of the Lesser Adjutant, but stance and bill-shape of the Painted Stork.
        <br><br><br><br>
        <span class="subheading">Why is it facing extinction?</span>
        <br><br>
        These Lesser Adjutants are facing numerous threats such as hunting pressure, the loss of nesting habitats, conversion and also the degradation of wetlands and agricultural changes and intensification. They have been listed in the Red List IUCN as vulnerable. <br>
